		<p>As per the guidelines, the patients who are clinically assigned to be mild /asymptomatic are recommended for home isolation. The asymptomatic cases are laboratory confirmed cases not experiencing any symptoms and having oxygen saturation at room air of more than 94%. Clinically assigned mild cases are patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms (&/or fever) without shortness of breath and having oxygen saturation at room air of more than 94%. Home quarantine means the time when a patient, who tests positive isolates himself/herself at home following all precautions and protocols suggested by medical authorities. Those with mild and moderate symptoms are usually advised to follow home quarantine. Having a self-isolation facility and caregiver support is crucial to a good recovery. </p>

		<p> Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations. The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups. Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine. A home quarantine period for a coronavirus patient can be brought to an end if at least 14-17 days have passed post the onset of symptoms.Those who have an asymptomatic infection can end their quarantine 10 days after first testing positive for the virus. Talking to your treating physician or doctor can also help you decide on the right time of ending isolation.</p>
