		<p id="vac"> India has an ambitious challenge of vaccinating its huge population by the end of this year. With the increasing number of vaccines and various firms joining the club, India will not only be able to achieve this dream but also resolve the constant scarcity of vaccine doses.</p>
		<p id="vac">
		1. Covishield:
		<br>
	The AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine ‘Covishield’ is locally manufactured by the Serum Institute of India in Pune. Covishield and Covaxin were the very first vaccines of the world's largest vaccination drive with on January 16 in India.  The vaccination is given in two doses, eight to twelve weeks apart. It can be safely maintained at temperatures ranging from 2 to 8 degrees Celsius and simply supplied in existing healthcare facilities such as doctors’ offices. Most Indians have taken jabs of this vaccine. </p>
	<p id="vac">
	2. Covaxin:
		<br>
	Covaxin works with an inactivated virus, i.e. it is made up of coronaviruses that have been killed, making it safe to inject into the body. Covaxin is manufactured by Bharat Biotech. The company exports to 123 countries and have a portfolio of 16 vaccines, using a coronavirus sample isolated by India’s National Institute of Virology. 
	<br>
The maximum price of Covishield for private Covid-19 Vaccination Centres (CVCs) has been fixed at Rs 780 per dose, while that of Covaxin is Rs 1,410 per dose. 
</p>
<p id="vac">
3. Sputnik V:
<br>
Sputnik V is manufactured by Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy’s Laboratories in India and has been developed by Russia’s Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, while being marketed globally by Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF). The vaccine makes use of two different viruses that cause the common cold (adenovirus) in humans. The two doses, given 21 days apart, are different and not interchangeable.
</p>
<p id="vac">
	4. Moderna
<br>
Moderna will become the fourth vaccine to be available for use in India. The vaccine doses will be imported by Indian drug manufacturer Cipla Ltd and will be under the central government’s purview. The Centre plans to provide the Moderna doses directly to states.

India is receiving the Moderna vaccine doses under the COVAX scheme of the World Health Organisation (WHO), a few days after the DGCI granted approval to it.
</p>

<p id="vac">
	5. Pfizer:
	<br>
US-based Pfizer is in the final stages of getting approval for its COVID-19 vaccine from the Indian government,  when approved, the pharma giant will supply one billion doses to India within this year.
